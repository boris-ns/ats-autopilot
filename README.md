# Autopilot for American Truck Simulator

Simple lane tracking assistant for [*American Truck Simulator*](https://americantrucksimulator.com/).  
The goal is to keep the truck inside its lane. Currently, it works the best on the highways and with little less accuracy on country roads. It does not support driving in the night, yet.
